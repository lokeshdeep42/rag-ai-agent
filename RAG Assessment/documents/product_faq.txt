FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY
===========================

Q7: How does file synchronization work?

------------------------------------------------------------

3. Click "Create Link"
4. Set permissions (view-only or edit)
5. Copy and share the link

-------------------------------------------------
A: Version history allows you to view and restore previous versions of your files. CloudSync automatically saves versions whenever a file is modified.
